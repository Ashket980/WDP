      <h1>How to reduce your carbon footprint at home</h1>
      <p>Let's start with some steps to reduce your carbon emissions at home. Most of these are fairly quick and easy to implement, meaning you can start
        living a more eco-friendly life in no time at all: <br></br>
      </p>

                     <h3> 1. Insulate your home </h3>
                <p>Heating your living space can be an expensive and energy-intensive process. By insulating places like your loft and walls, 
                  you can make sure your home retains heat during the winter and stays cool in summer. It means you’ll use less energy, reduci
                  ng your carbon footprint and your household bills.</p>  

                <h3>2. Switch to renewables </h3>
                <p>Energy providers around the world are now offering greener tariffs. By switching to a company that provides electricity 
                  from solar, wind, or hydroelectric energy, you can reduce your household emissions and save money on your energy bills. You
                   could even install solar panels if they're readily available where you live. </p>
                <h3>3. Buy energy efficient </h3>
                <p>Electrical appliances are becoming more efficient by the year. What's more, many countries now show how efficient particular
                   products are, meaning you can make an informed choice. </p>

                <h3>4. Use less water </h3>
                <p>It takes energy and resources to process and deliver water to our homes. What's more, it's also quite energy-intensive to heat 
                  it once it's there. So, by using less, you can help the environment and lower your carbon footprint. Try turning off the taps 
                  when brushing your teeth, having short showers rather than baths, and only boiling the water you need. </p>

                <h3>5. Change your diet</h3>
                <p>The food we eat can have a significant impact on the environment. For example, meat and dairy products require a lot of land,
                   water and energy to produce. They also create a lot of methane, a greenhouse gas. By eating fewer animal products, especially red meat, 
                   (or even choosing a plant-based diet) and shopping for locally sourced food,you can make a big difference. Why not support your local farmers'
                    market?</p>
