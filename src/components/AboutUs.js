      <h1> Improvement in climate change cases</h1>
      <p>Another good thing about thecarbon footprint tracker, is that it can help people see the need to address the issue of climate change. By tracking your emissions, you’ll better understand the environmental impacts of certain activities you involve in and the products you use. By identifying these impacts, you’ll be able to adjust accordingly and reduce their effects on the immediate environment.</p>





      <h1>The biggest causes of CO2 emissions</h1> 
So, what is it that’s driving these emissions? And how does that impact your carbon footprint? There are a few main industries that create the majority of the greenhouse gasses we produce. Global data from 2016 shows the main culprits: 

<p>● Energy (the burning of fossil fuels) produced 36013.52 million tonnes of CO2e.<br></br>
● Agriculture produced 5795.51 million tonnes of CO2e.<br></br>
● Land-use change and forestry (altering or converting land) produced 3217.07 million tonnes of CO2e.<br></br>
● Industrial processes produced 2771.08 million tonnes of CO2e.<br></br>
● Waste produced 1560.85 million tonnes of CO2e.</p>

<h1>Effective tips for reducing your carbon emissions</h1>
      <p>
For you to reduce your carbon footprints effectively, you need to follow the best practices below:<br></br>
<br></br>
● First, you need to start by choosing a reliable carbon footprint calculator, such as the Carbano App. With this calculator, you can easily measure your daily carbon footprints and work effectively on ways to lower your emissions.
<br></br>
● You can also lower your emissions by focusing more on the use of energy-saving appliances and products at home. For instance, instead of using air conditioners, you can decide to use fans and take advantage of natural ventilation.
<br></br>
● Cutting down the rate at which you travel and commute can also reduce carbon emissions significantly. If it’s not necessary, you don’t have to go for any air trips.</p>
